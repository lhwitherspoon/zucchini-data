# Zucchini Tech Website Project
Inspired by Eldin Heric's [*Potato Landing Page*](https://dribbble.com/shots/2042501-Potato-landing-page), this project asks the question: what would be possible if we could integrate Big Zucchini with Big Data? Finally, a use for those monster zukes that you forgot were growing in the garden. 

This site features vanilla HTML5 and CSS Grid layout.
