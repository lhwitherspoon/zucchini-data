                <h3>The new server farm.</h3>
                <p>Think zucchini is only good for zucchini bread and blue ribbons? Think again. Beset by bushels of
                    baseball
                    bat-size courgettes*, our engineers saw possibility in this prolific garden denizen. Utilizing the
                    latest in
                    quantum computing (and some tomatoes), they found a way to connect courgettes into circuits.</p>

                <h3>Stuff them with data.</h3>
                <p>Zucchini come in a wide range of sizes, expressed in units called zukes. Each zucchini can hold data
                    in
                    proportion to its volume. Our software scales the number of zukes (zucchini modules) to fit your
                    organization's
                    precise data needs. So whether you need gigabytes or zettabytes, your data needs are always covered.

                <h3>Naturally neural.</h3>
                <p>Our engineers dove into how zucchini vines spread, entwine, and produce prolifically. We then used
                    that
                    information to develop and refine machine-learning algorithims. The result was a significant boost
                    in
                    the
                    speed
                    at which neural networks achieved target accuracy. Now imagine what this can do for your
                    organization's
                    data,
                    people, and revenue.</p>

                <h3>Locally-sourced storage that's globally available.</h3>
                <p>Thanks to the widespread cultivation of zucchini, you can choose to store data locally, regionally,
                    or
                    globally.
                    Region-specific variants are available to meet regulatory compliance requirements. Onsite Zucchini
                    Server
                    installations are available; contact our HomeGrown Data division for specifics.</p>
